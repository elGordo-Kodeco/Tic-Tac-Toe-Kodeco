/// Represents an alert in the Tic-Tac-Toe game, with customizable title, message, and button title.
///
/// `AlertItem` is designed to create consistent, identifiable alerts for game outcomes, such as wins, losses, or draws.
/// Each alert has a unique identifier to support SwiftUIâ€™s `Identifiable` protocol and can trigger an optional action
/// when dismissed.
///
/// - Properties:
///     - `id`: A unique identifier for the alert, used for conforming to `Identifiable`.
///     - `title`: The title text displayed at the top of the alert.
///     - `message`: The message text providing additional details in the alert.
///     - `buttonTitle`: The title of the button that dismisses the alert.
/// - Methods:
///     - `setAlert(action:)`: Generates a SwiftUI `Alert` with the specified properties and an optional
///      dismissal action.
struct AlertItem: Identifiable {

    /// A unique identifier for the alert, allowing SwiftUI to manage alert presentation.

    var message: Text

    /// The title of the button that dismisses the alert.
    var buttonTitle: Text

    /// Creates a SwiftUI `Alert` with the specified title, message, and dismiss button.
    ///
    /// - Parameter action: An optional closure to execute when the alert's dismiss button is tapped.
    /// - Returns: A configured `Alert` instance with the provided title, message, and button action.

/// allowing easy access to alert configurations for different game results.
